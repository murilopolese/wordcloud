# Speech to text to cloud

This is an experiment inspired by [Amos Blanton's](http://www.amosamos.net/) project [speech2wordcloud](https://gitlab.com/Lightnin/speech2wordcloud).

**Disclaimers**:

- Only works with Google Chrome's native Speech recognition API, which uses cloud services and will potentially violate everything I personally believe about data privacy.
- The use of pre-selected stop words will not work for all contexts and as far as I experienced, the better it gets for one context, the worst it gets for other contexts.
- I have faced various situations where the final word cloud selected words that felt terribly wrong, pointing towards discrimination and racism.
- I do not recommend using this software for anything else than as evidence of how the technologies used are not adequate.
